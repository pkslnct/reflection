What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when we initialize a repository a .git directory is formed in the working directory.
We need to initialize git so that we can save our history and git can keep track of our commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is used to store the fils which we want to commit .It gives us the flexibility to choose only the files we want to commit in a single commit.
